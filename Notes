Lessons to keep in mind:
-I had trouble with the coordinates of the pieces on the board, it would have been good to deal with the mismatch
between the nested array (array[y][x]) and the normal coordinates system where x comes before y early on.
-This is python, negative numbers in arrays wont throw an exception. (maybe use assertion?)
- you can't delete things from a list while iterating over it. It screws with the indexes.
- Make a general function that checks if squares are valid to move to (on the board and not occupied by a friendly
  piece)
- Make a detailed map of what you want to do so that you will be able to jump in after months of leaving the project.
- Function names should work with keywords like if. for example: instead of val_select write select_valid. It is much
  mor understandable to see 'if select_valid' than 'if val_select'
- Maybe it would have been better to give the piece class a property of the board it is on (although there is only one
  option). It would have made the code easier to understand and remove redundancies like
  game_board.piece.move(x, y, game_board)
